# Blog Post API

## Summary

Simple API program that parses and analyzes posts from an publicly available API. This project was done on my own time for learning purposes. It incorperates REST API techniques, multi-threading and optimized algorithms (done with O(nlogn)).

## Manual setup

- Make sure Python and Pip is installed on your machine.
- Install the requirements in requirements.txt using `pip install -r  requirements.txt`

## Running the app

Default port number of the API is 5050. Thus, once you run `python api_main.py` and enter `localhost:5050` on your browser. If all is well, you should see a page with the text "Hello", confirming that you have setup everything properly.

You can then visit local `localhost:5050/swagger` to view all the available routes in the API.

## Running testcases

Running test cases can be done by executing this command: `python -m pytest` in the `blog_posts` directory.
